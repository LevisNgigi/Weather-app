<h1 align="center">Weather App</h1> 

This project is about building a web application to show a weather forecast using weather API from external services [Open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/). Here you will be able to search for a specific location in the world and also it will automatically detect your current location in the beginning (for that you need to allow location) and will display all the important weather details such as humidity abd wind speed.
To use the app, type a name of the city and click on search/press Enter or else click on the Your location weather button, every time you click on the button first it will check if the data is available in the session storage or not, and if not then it will send a network request else it will take the data from session-storage.
